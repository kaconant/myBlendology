myBlendology is a web application comprised of a PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React, & NodeJS) that allows you to create diffuser essential oil blends based off of a user's choice of mood.

## The Approach

The user begins the application by selecting one of three moods: Calm, Awaken, or Sensual. Each choice will generate three separate carousels divided by level. 

* Base oils provide the lasting impression of your blend. These oils are typically heavy and will provide the final note of your blend.
* Middle oils are considered the heart of your blend and will emerge after your top oil has faded. These oils often balance your blend and are typically well-rounded.
* Top oils provide your first impression of your blend. These oils are often described as light and fresh, but tend to fade quickly.
