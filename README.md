myBlendology is a web application comprised of a PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React, & NodeJS) that allows you to create diffuser essential oil blends based off of a user's choice of mood.

## The Approach

The user begins the application by selecting one of three moods: Calm, Awaken, or Sensual. Each choice will generate three separate carousels divided by level. 

* Base oils provide the lasting impression of your blend. These oils are typically heavy and will provide the final note of your blend.
* Middle oils are considered the heart of your blend and will emerge after your top oil has faded. These oils often balance your blend and are typically well-rounded.
* Top oils provide your first impression of your blend. These oils are often described as light and fresh, but tend to fade quickly.

## The Result

After the user selects one oil from each carousel, they will be provided the essential oil amount needed per oil to create the right balance for their mood blend.
